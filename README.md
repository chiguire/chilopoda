chilopoda
=========

By: Ciro Duran <ciro.duran@gmail.com>  
Made with Octet Game Framework, designed and implemented by Andy Thomason
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/octetframework/>  
October-November 2013

Chilopoda is a Centipede clone (google Atari Centipede for more information). The game 
was made to demonstrate regular use of container structures made in the framework and
a simple custom shader that goes a bit more than the usual examples.

Octet is a cross-platform game development framework for developing games on Windows,
Mac and other platforms.

It is designed to be very simple, dependency-free and very fast to build.
